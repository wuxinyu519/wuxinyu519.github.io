I am currently pursuing a PhD in the Computer Science Department at Baylor University, Texas, under the supervision of [**Dr. Chen Zhao**](https://charliezhaoyinpeng.github.io/homepage/). Prior to this, I completed my M.S. in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Dongguk University (DGU), South Korea, in March 2024, under the guidance of [Prof. Hyerung Jang](https://sites.google.com/view/hrjang/home). 

**Outside of my academic life**, I have a cat named Taurus, who has accompanied me across South Korea, China, and the United States. In my free time, I enjoy watching comedy series, learning new hobbies, and swimming, which I find to be the perfect way to relax. If you share an interest in cats, traveling, or swimming, feel free to connect—I’m always open to a chat!


Research Interests
======
My current research focuses on the following areas:

**Generative Model** - A key area in machine learning aimed at generating data samples from complex distributions and learning meaningful representations from unlabelled data across various domains such as audio, images, video, and text.

**Representation Learning** - In this area, I work on developing algorithms that extract meaningful patterns from raw data to create representations that are easier to interpret and process. These representations can be designed for interpretability, uncover hidden features, or support transfer learning, with applications in fundamental tasks like image classification and retrieval.
