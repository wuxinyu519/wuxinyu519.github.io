About
======
I am currently an PhD student in the Computer Science at Baylor University, Texas, US, under the supervision of [**Dr. Chen Zhao**](https://charliezhaoyinpeng.github.io/homepage/). Since March 2024, I received my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence from Dongguk University (DGU), South Korea, in 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Hyerung Jang](https://sites.google.com/view/hrjang/home). 

Beyond academics**, I adopted a cute cat named Taurus, who has traveled with me across South Korea, China, and the United States. When I’m free, I usually watch comedy series, learn new hobbies, and swim, as it's my favorite way to unwind. So, if you're interested in cats, traveling, or swimming, feel free to reach out—I'm definitely in!

Research
======
Here are a few specific fields of my current research topics:

**Generative Model** - A pivotal area in machine learning to generate data samples from complex distributions and learn meaningful representations from unlabelled data in various applications such as audio, images, video, and text.

**Representation Learning** - A process in machine learning where algorithms extract meaningful patterns from raw data to create representations that are easier to understand and process. These representations can be designed for interpretability, reveal hidden features, or be used for transfer learning. They are valuable across many fundamental machine learning tasks like image classification and retrieval.
